# hello-world
My first repository so i can learn to use Github

Hello, im Johannes, im 20 years old and new to Github.
Im currently studying Computer Science with a main focus on Software-Engineering and Development.
I like to work with embedded systems like Arduinos, but im also interrested in Machine Learning and Video-Games (Not only playing them but also making them).
At the beginning i want to focus on some Basics like trees, sorting algorithms, computer graphics and learnign to use more features of the language C++.

In this branch i have changed the README.md file by writing about myself.
I have created this branch in order to learn how to make branches and then commit to them.
